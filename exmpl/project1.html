             <p>The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either
                  directly or indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets,
                  with the remainder being smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects
                  that orbit the Sun indirectly—the moons—two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.</p>
             <p>The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar
                molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining
                mass contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial
                nets, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are giant planets, being 
                substantially massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, 
                being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice
                giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen 
                and helium, called volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane. All eight planets have almost circular
                orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.</p>
            <p>The Solar System also contains smaller objects. The asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits
               of Mars and Jupiter, mostly contains objects composed, like the terrestrial planets, of rock and
               metal. Beyond Neptune's orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc, which are populations of
               trans-Neptunian objects composed mostly of ices, and beyond them a newly discovered population
               of sednoids. Within these populations, some objects are large enough to have rounded under their
               own gravity, though there is considerable debate as to how many there will prove to be.
               Such objects are categorized as dwarf planets. Identified or accepted dwarf planets include the 
               asteroid Ceres and the trans-Neptunian objects Pluto and Eris. In addition to these two regions,
               various other small-body populations, including comets, centaurs and interplanetary dust clouds, 
               freely travel between regions. Six of the planets, the six largest possible dwarf planets, and many
               of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites, usually termed "moons" after the Moon.
               Each of the outer planets is encircled by planetary rings of dust and other small objects.</p>
            <p> The solar wind, a stream of charged particles flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble-like
                region in the interstellar medium known as the heliosphere. The heliopause is the point at which 
               pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of the interstellar medium; it extends 
               out to the edge of the scattered disc. The Oort cloud, which is thought to be the source for long-period 
               comets, may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere. The Solar
               System is located in the Orion Arm, 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy. </p>

                <h3 id="history"><u>HISTORY</u></h3>

            <p>For most of history, humanity did not recognize or understand the concept of the Solar System.
                Most people up to the Late Middle Ages–Renaissance believed Earth to be stationary at the centre
                of the universe and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through 
                the sky. Although the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos had speculated on a heliocentric reordering 
                 of the cosmos, Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to develop a mathematically predictive heliocentric system.</p>
            <p>In the 17th century, Galileo discovered that the Sun was marked with sunspots, and that Jupiter had 
                four satellites in orbit around it.[13] Christiaan Huygens followed on from Galileo's discoveries by
                discovering Saturn's moon Titan and the shape of the rings of Saturn.[14] Edmond Halley realised in 
                1705 that repeated sightings of a comet were recording the same object, returning regularly once every
                75–76 years. This was the first evidence that anything other than the planets orbited the Sun.[15] Around
                this time (1704), the term "Solar System" first appeared in English.[16] In 1838, Friedrich Bessel 
                successfully measured a stellar parallax, an apparent shift in the position of a star created by Earth's
                motion around the Sun, providing the first direct, experimental proof of heliocentrism.[17] Improvements
                in observational astronomy and the use of unmanned spacecraft have since enabled the detailed investigation 
                of other bodies orbiting the Sun.</p>

            <dl>
            <dt><b>Structure and composition</b></dt>
            <dd>
            <p>The principal component of the Solar System is the Sun, a G2 main-sequence star that 
                contains 99.86% of the system's known mass and dominates it gravitationally.[18] 
                The Sun's four largest orbiting bodies, the giant planets, account for 99% of the
                 remaining mass, with Jupiter and Saturn together comprising more than 90%. 
                 The remaining objects of the Solar System (including the four terrestrial planets,
                 the dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, and comets) together comprise less than 0.002% 
                 of the Solar System's total mass.[h]</p>
            <p>Most large objects in orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known
                 as the ecliptic. The planets are very close to the ecliptic, whereas comets and
                Kuiper belt objects are frequently at significantly greater angles to it.[22][23]
                 As a result of the formation of the Solar System planets, and most other objects,
                orbit the Sun in the same direction that the Sun is rotating (counter-clockwise, 
                 as viewed from above Earth's north pole).[24] There are exceptions, such as Halley's 
                 Comet. Most of the larger moons orbit their planets in this prograde direction (with Triton being the largest retrograde exception) and most larger objects rotate themselves in the same direction (with Venus being a notable retrograde exception).</p>
            <p>The overall structure of the charted regions of the Solar System consists of the Sun, four 
                relatively small inner planets surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant
                 planets surrounded by the Kuiper belt of mostly icy objects. Astronomers sometimes informally 
                 divide this structure into separate regions. The inner Solar System includes the four terrestrial 
                 planets and the asteroid belt. The outer Solar System is beyond the asteroids, including the four
                  giant planets.[25] Since the discovery of the Kuiper belt, the outermost parts of the Solar System
                   are considered a distinct region consisting of the objects beyond Neptune.[26]</p>
            </dd>
         
           <dt><b>Distances and scales</b></dt>
           <dd> 
            <p>The distance from Earth to the Sun is 1 astronomical unit [AU] (150,000,000 km; 93,000,000 mi).
                 For comparison, the radius of the Sun is 0.0047 AU (700,000 km). Thus, the Sun occupies 0.00001% 
                (10−5 %) of the volume of a sphere with a radius the size of Earth's orbit, whereas Earth's volume 
                is roughly one millionth (10−6) that of the Sun. Jupiter, the largest planet, is 5.2 astronomical
                 units (780,000,000 km) from the Sun and has a radius of 71,000 km (0.00047 AU), whereas the most
                distant planet, Neptune, is 30 AU (4.5×109 km) from the Sun.</p>
            
            <p>With a few exceptions, the farther a planet or belt is from the Sun, the larger the distance
                 between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearer object to the Sun. For example, Venus 
                 is approximately 0.33 AU farther out from the Sun than Mercury, whereas Saturn is 4.3 AU 
                 out from Jupiter, and Neptune lies 10.5 AU out from Uranus. Attempts have been made to determine 
                 a relationship between these orbital distances (for example, the Titius–Bode law),[37] but no such
                theory has been accepted. The images at the beginning of this section show the orbits of the
                various constituents of the Solar System on different scales.</p>
            </dd>
       
            <dt><b>Formation and evolution</b></dt>
            <dd>  
            <p>The Solar System formed 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a 
                 region within a large molecular cloud.[i] This initial cloud was likely several light-years
                 across and probably birthed several stars.[43] As is typical of molecular clouds, this one
                  consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements fused 
                 by previous generations of stars. As the region that would become the Solar System, known as 
                 the pre-solar nebula,[44] collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster. 
                 The centre, where most of the mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc.
                 [43] As the contracting nebula rotated faster, it began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a 
                 diameter of roughly 200 AU[43] and a hot, dense protostar at the centre.[45][46] The planets formed 
                 by accretion from this disc,[47] in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other,
                 coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early 
                 Solar System, but they either merged or were destroyed, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and 
                 leftover minor bodies.</p>
            <p>Within 50 million years, the pressure and density of hydrogen in the centre of the protostar
                 became great enough for it to begin thermonuclear fusion.[49] The temperature, reaction rate,
                  pressure, and density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved: the thermal pressure 
                  equalled the force of gravity. At this point, the Sun became a main-sequence star.[50] The
                   main-sequence phase, from beginning to end, will last about 10 billion years for the Sun 
                   compared to around two billion years for all other phases of the Sun's pre-remnant life 
                   combined.[51] Solar wind from the Sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining 
                   gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space, ending the planetary
                    formation process. The Sun is growing brighter; early in its main-sequence life its brightness 
                    was 70% that of what it is today.[52]</p></dd>

             <h3 id="sun"><u>SUN</u></h3>
            <p>The Sun is the Solar System's star and by far its most massive component. 
               Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses),[54] which comprises 99.86% of all the mass 
               in the Solar System,[55] produces temperatures and densities in its core high enough
               to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium, making it a main-sequence star.[56] 
               This releases an enormous amount of energy, mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic
               radiation peaking in visible light.[57]</p>
            <p>The Sun is a G2-type main-sequence star. Hotter main-sequence stars are more luminous. 
               The Sun's temperature is intermediate between that of the hottest stars and that of the
               coolest stars. Stars brighter and hotter than the Sun are rare, whereas substantially
               dimmer and cooler stars, known as red dwarfs, make up 85% of the stars in the Milky Way.[58][59]</p>
            <p>The Sun is a population I star; it has a higher abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and
                helium ("metals" in astronomical parlance) than the older population II stars.[60]
                Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were formed in the cores of ancient and 
                exploding stars, so the first generation of stars had to die before the Universe could
                be enriched with these atoms. The oldest stars contain few metals, whereas stars born
                later have more. This high metallicity is thought to have been crucial to the Sun's 
                development of a planetary system because the planets form from the accretion of "metals".[6</p>

                         <dd>Mercury (0.4 AU from the Sun) is the closest planet to the Sun and on average,
                         all seven other planets.[75][76] The smallest planet in the Solar System (0.055 M⊕), 
                          Mercury has no natural satellites. Besides impact craters, its only known geological 
                          features are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a period of contraction 
                          early in its history.[77] Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off 
                          its surface by the solar wind.[78] Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not 
                          yet been adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by 
                          a giant impact, or that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young Sun's energy.[79][80]</dd>

                          mantle around an iron core, a substantial atmosphere, and evidence of internal geological activity. 
                          It is much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense. Venus has no natural satellites. 
                           It is the hottest planet, with surface temperatures over 400 °C (752 °F), most likely due to the amount of
                          greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.[81] No definitive evidence of current geological activity has been 
                          detected on Venus, but it has no magnetic field that would prevent depletion of its substantial atmosphere, 
                          which suggests that its atmosphere is being replenished by volcanic eruptions.[82]</dd>

                           current geological activity, and the only place where life is known to exist.[83] Its liquid hydrosphere 
                           is unique among the terrestrial planets, and it is the only planet where plate tectonics has been observed. 
                           Earth's atmosphere is radically different from those of the other planets, having been altered by the presence 
                            of life to contain 21% free oxygen.[84] It has one natural satellite, the Moon, the only large satellite of a

                            of mostly carbon dioxide with a surface pressure of 6.1 millibars (roughly 0.6% of that of Earth).[85]

                             shows geological activity that may have persisted until as recently as 2 million years ago.[86] Its red 
                              colour comes from iron oxide (rust) in its soil.[87] Mars has two tiny natural satellites (Deimos and Phobos) 
                             thought to be either captured asteroids,[88] or ejected debris from a massive impact early in Mars's history.</dd>

                               It is composed largely of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter's strong internal heat creates 
                                semi-permanent features in its atmosphere, such as cloud bands and the Great Red Spot. 
                              Jupiter has 79 known satellites. The four largest, Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa, show similarities
                              to the terrestrial planets, such as volcanism and internal heating.[99] Ganymede, the largest satellite

                            it is less than a third as massive, at 95 M⊕. Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is 
                            less dense than water.[100] The rings of Saturn are made up of small ice and rock particles. Saturn has 
                            82 confirmed satellites composed largely of ice. Two of these, Titan and Enceladus, show signs of geological 
                            activity.[101] Titan, the second-largest moon in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury and the only
